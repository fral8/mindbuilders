## Intro
Setting up a domestic electronic maker desk can be a great way to have a dedicated space for your electronics projects and hobbies at home. Setting up a maker desk can be a fun and rewarding process, and it can also help to keep your tools and materials organized and easily accessible.

## Choice the right Location
The first step in setting up your maker desk is to choose the right location. You will want to choose a space that is well-lit, has plenty of room for your tools and materials, and is away from any potential hazards. A spare room, a corner of the garage, or a dedicated area in your home office can all work well as a maker space.

## Furnitures
Next, you will need to choose the right furniture for your maker desk. A sturdy and durable work surface is essential, and a large desk or workbench can work well. IKEA is a great place to find affordable furniture that is both functional and stylish.

For storage, you will want to choose a combination of shelves, drawers, and cabinets. This will help to keep your tools and materials organized and easily accessible. IKEA's [Kallax] (https://www.ikea.com/it/it/search/?q=kallax) series is a great option. This combination of open and closed storage will ensure that you have a place for everything.

IKEA's Markus chair is a comfortable and adjustable option for seating and the [Jansjo](https://www.ikea.com/it/it/p/jansjoe-lampada-usb-a-led-nero-70291232/) work lamp will provide enough light for your work surface.

This will likely include soldering equipment, multimeters, power supplies, and a variety of hand tools. These electronic tools can be found on Amazon, a popular and affordable option for a soldering station is the Weller WLC100 40-Watt Soldering Station, which can be purchased on Amazon for around $50.

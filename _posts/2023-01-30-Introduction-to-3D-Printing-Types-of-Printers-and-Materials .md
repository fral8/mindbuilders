## Intro
3D printing is a revolutionary technology that allows for the creation of complex, three-dimensional objects using digital designs. With the advancements in technology, 3D printing is becoming more accessible to the general public and is being used in various industries such as manufacturing, medicine, and art.

There are several types of 3D printers available on the market today, each with its own unique capabilities and limitations. The most common types of 3D printers include Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS).
## FDM
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is the most widely used type of 3D printer. It works by heating a thermoplastic filament and extruding it through a nozzle, layer by layer, to create the object. FDM printers are relatively affordable and easy to use, making them a popular choice for hobbyists and educators.
## SLA
Stereolithography (SLA) printers use a laser to cure a liquid resin, layer by layer, to create the object. SLA printers are capable of producing high-resolution, detailed objects, but they can be more expensive and require more maintenance than FDM printers.
## SLS
Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) printers use a laser to fuse together small particles of plastic, metal, or ceramic powder, layer by layer, to create the object. SLS printers are capable of producing highly detailed, durable objects, but they can be very expensive and require a high level of expertise to operate.
## Material
In addition to the different types of printers, there are also various materials that can be used for 3D printing. These include plastics like ABS and PLA, as well as metal, ceramics, and even food. The materials used will depend on the specific application and the capabilities of the printer being used.

## Outro
If you're new to 3D printing, we recommend starting with a FDM printer and using a plastic filament like ABS or PLA. As you become more comfortable with the technology, you can explore different types of printers and materials to find the best fit for your needs.

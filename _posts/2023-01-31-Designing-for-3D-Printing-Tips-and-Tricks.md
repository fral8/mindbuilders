## Intro
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printers are a popular choice for hobbyists and educators due to their affordability and ease of use. However, designing models for FDM 3D printing can be a bit tricky for beginners. In this article, we will provide tips and tricks for designing models for FDM 3D printing, including the most commonly used software, important parameters, and the workflow for creating and printing a model.
## Workflow
The workflow for creating and printing a model with an FDM printer is as follows:

1. Design your model using the software of your choice, keeping in mind the important parameters mentioned above.
2. Export your model as an STL file, which is the standard file format for 3D printing.
3. Prepare your model for printing using a slicing software, this software will generate the gcode, which is the instructions for the printer.
4. Load the gcode onto the printer and start printing.
5. Once the printing is finished, remove the model from the printer and remove any support structures.
6. Clean the model and post-process as needed.
## Design Model Software
One of the most important things to consider when designing for FDM 3D printing is the software you will use. The most popular software for FDM 3D printing include:
-Tinkercad: a simple, browser-based 3D design tool that is perfect for beginners
-Fusion 360: a powerful, professional-grade software that offers advanced features and capabilities
-SketchUp: a user-friendly 3D modeling software that is popular among architects and designers
## Crucial Parameters
When designing a model for FDM 3D printing, it is important to consider the following parameters:
-Wall thickness: the thickness of the walls of the model should be at least 1.5mm to ensure that the model is strong enough to withstand the printing process
-Overhangs: if a model has overhangs that are too steep, it may be difficult to print and may require support structures
-Scale: the model should be scaled correctly to ensure that it will print at the desired size
## Slicing Software
Some of the most popular slicing software used for FDM 3D printing include:

- Cura: a free, open-source slicing software that is compatible with a wide range of 3D printers. It offers a user-friendly interface and advanced features such as support generation, multi-extruder support, and more.

- Slic3r: another open-source slicing software that is known for its advanced features and customization options. It is compatible with a wide range of 3D printers and offers a high level of control over the slicing process.

- Simplify3D: a commercial slicing software that is known for its advanced features and high-quality results. It offers a wide range of customization options and is compatible with a wide range of 3D printers.

When preparing your model for printing, it is important to consider the capabilities of your printer and the software you are using. For example, if your printer has multiple extruders, you will need to choose slicing software that supports multi-extruder printing. Additionally, you should experiment with different settings such as layer height, infill, and support structures to achieve the best results.

Overall, slicing software is an essential tool for preparing 3D models for printing with an FDM 3D printer. By using the right slicing software and understanding the capabilities and limitations of your printer, you can achieve high-quality results and create amazing 3D prints.

## Outro
In conclusion, FDM 3D printers are a great choice for beginners and offer a wide range of capabilities. By following these tips and tricks, you can create high-quality models that will print successfully. Remember to choose the right software, consider the important parameters, and follow the workflow outlined above. With the right approach, you will be able to create amazing 3D prints in no time.
